A demo using the Tumblr API

This simple demo ap uses the Tumblr SDK to present a slideshow using photo posts from the user's dashboard. 
Tapping on the photo opens the original post in a modal view. 
Swiping on the collection view stops the slideshow allowing the user to scroll through photos manually.
